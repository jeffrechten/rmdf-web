    title: "Saline Township Residents Appeal Permit for Saline Data Center to Zoning Board of Appeals",
    summary:
      "Saline Township residents appealed a zoning permit for the proposed Saline Data Center, triggering an automatic halt to construction while the Zoning Board of Appeals reviews claims that the permit violates township zoning law and improperly treats agricultural land as industrial.",
    location: "Saline Township, Mich.",
    body: [
      "Saline Township residents opened a second front in the battle to protect their agricultural community and stop the proposed hyperscale data center by Related Digital, appealing a zoning permit Saline Township granted on December 4, which permitted fencing and temporary construction structures.",
      "The appeal was filed this week with the Saline Township Zoning Board of Appeals and the official who issued the permit, and called on the Township to enforce the provision in Michigan law that automatically stays the permit while the ZBA appeal case is pending. Construction has begun at the site, but must now halt.",
      "The Zoning Board of Appeals is required to hold a public hearing within 90 days to hear and decide the appeal. Page 2 of one appellant, Preston Dyer Jr., lives next door to the site’s entrance. Another appellant, Kathryn Haushalter sued last weekend to overturn the consent judgment filed in Washtenaw County Circuit Court. The third appellant is Joshua Day LeBaron. The grounds for the appeal are described in a 16-page Notice of Appeal, available on https://ruralmidefense.org/.",
	  "The permit, the residents say, violated the zoning ordinance and should be revoked by the ZBA, because the Township planner erroneously relied on the Zoning Map that has not been changed, as the property still shows the land is agricultural, not industrial. The Township Board never amended the zoning ordinance to effectuate the change. The Consent Judgement did not, and could not, rezone the property because only the Township Board has the power to legislate and amend the ordinance. A provision in Saline Township’s zoning ordinance requires it “shall” conform to a court decree.",
	  "The Consent Judgement is silent on the Zoning Map, and the terms direct that anything the agreement is silent on, the Saline Township Zoning Ordinance controls. The Zoning Map is “the final authority” in determining which land parcels are within each zone.  Without adopting an amendment to change the zoning district boundaries on the Zoning Map at a public meeting, and publishing it, the rezoning legislation never happened. ",
	  "Community supporters have rallied behind the residents, forming two organizations, Stop the Saline Data Center and nonprofit Rural Michigan Defense Fund. Learn more at: www.stopsalinedatacenter.org and https://ruralmidefense.org/",

    title: "Saline Township Resident Takes Legal Action to Stop Saline Data Center, Citing Open Meetings Act Violations",
    summary:
      "Saline Township Resident Takes Legal Action to Stop Saline Data Center.",
    location: "Saline Township, Mich.",
    body: [
      "A Saline Township resident filed in Washtenaw County Circuit Court on December 13 to seek intervention in the case between Saline Township and Related Digital over the “hyperscale” data center proposed for a location in Saline Township that resulted in a Consent Judgment, claiming that Township officials violated an Open Meetings Act requirement to make decisions in open, public meetings, and never voted on the finalized  consent judgment language.",
      "The enormity of the proposed “Stargate” data center, sought by project developer Related Digital for Oracle and OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, threatens to overwhelm the farming community in and around Saline Township. The proposed $7 billion, 1.4GW massive hyperscale data center would sprawl across 2.2 million square feet on a 575-acre site in Saline Township with an additional 476 acres in Bridgewater Township. It would be the largest data center in the country and use as much power as nearly one million homes.",
      "Resident Kathryn Haushalter, who lives near the proposed data center site, one of many residents opposed to the project, filed a Motion to Intervene and other court papers through attorneys Robby Dube and Ellis Boal.",
	  "Saline and communities from across the state have rallied behind the effort, including from local activist group, Stop the Saline Data Center. Nonprofit social welfare organization Rural Michigan Defense Fund will be collecting donations to support the effort. To learn more, see: https://www.stopsalinedatacenter.org/ and https://ruralmidefense.org/.",
	  "Dube stated, “This is the first salvo in the battle between Michigan citizens and the data centers that are trying to flood Michigan. We have filed to intervene into the Saline lawsuit so we can throw out the consent judgment that was  negotiated and signed in secret. Then, we will do what Saline Township was unwilling to do: fight to show the original decision to deny rezoning was valid. Data centers cannot be permitted to use lawfare to override the democratic will of the people.”",
	  "Haushalter said, “Our township board had no right to vote secretly and usher in a predatory data center in the middle of our farmland community through unlawful re-zoning. We will now stand with the citizens of Saline Township and fight for our right to say no to this project. I will always defend the people and fight for what's right.”",
	  "After returning from deployment in Afghanistan with the United States Marine Corps, Haushalter moved to the Township. She and her husband renovated a nearly-200-year old farmhouse where they are raising their children. Their land is in active farming.",
	  "Related Digital formed a limited liability corporation, RD Michigan Property Owner 1, which together with a handful of local landowners willing to sell, applied in July for a “conditional rezoning” of eight parcels on the western edge of Saline Township, adjacent to Bridgewater Township, on the north side of US-12/Michigan Avenue. The Township Planning Commission voted to recommend denying the rezoning. On September 10th, the Board of Trustees also voted to deny the request.",
	  "RD Michigan Property Owner 1 and the property owners sued the Township two days later, claiming the Township had “exclusionary zoning.”",
	  "On October 1st, the Saline Township Board met and while in closed session took a vote to “move forward to try to settle the lawsuit.” Voting during a closed session violates the Open Meetings Act.",
	  "Without any further open board meetings or board approval on final language, the Township Supervisor and Clerk—just two of the five-member board—signed the final version of the Consent judgment and filed it with the Court on October 15, again violating the Open Meetings Act.",
	  "Proposed Intervening Defendant (Haushalter)’s documents include:",
	  "Motion to Intervene",
	  "Brief in Support of Motion to Intervene",
	  "Proposed Answer and Cross-Claim",
	  "Saline Township’s website has posted the Consent Judgment, and Related Digital’s lawsuit against Saline Township and original application for “conditional rezoning” at salinetownship.org.",
